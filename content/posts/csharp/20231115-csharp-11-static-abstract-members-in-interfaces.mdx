Static abstract members in interfaces is one of in my opinion the coolest and most useful features added to interfaces
since I started using C# about 9 years ago. But it seems that almost no one is talking about them.

Other than their use in [Generic Math][generic-math] introduced with .NET 7, which seemed to take most of the lime light
from this feature, I haven't seen many videos or posts talking about their introduction as a feature. Which is crazy
because they've already been so useful to me in this past year since their introduction.

So without further adieu let's talk about Static abstract/virtual members and interfaces!

# First a quick introduction

Now I've said already twice it's one of my favourite features added in C# 11, but let's go back to the beginning. What
exactly does Static Abstract Members in Interfaces mean and how can we use them to write better code?

This feature requires C# 11 on .NET 7 but it can be enabled without .NET 7 if you turn on [preview features][preview-features]
in .NET 6. Once the feature is enabled you can add `static abstract{:cs}` or `static virtual{:cs}` members to your
interfaces without getting a compiler error. It also allows you to define other methods that are typically static on your
interface type such as operators & conversions.

Now on the surface without an explanation of what this enables, it might sound like a boring feature but... I'm here to
tell you that this enables some great functionality with interfaces that can make Generic Programming much easier.

Let's start with a basic example, similar to how the feature was introduced in Microsoft's Welcome to C# 11 blog, using
it to make math operations generic. Let's start by defining a new function `Generic.AddValues<T>(params T[] values){:cs}`:

```cs
public static class Generic
{
  public static T AddValues<T>(params T[] values) where T : INumber<T> =>
    values.Aggregate(T.Zero, (current, value) => current + value);
}
```

Above we're defining a function called `Generic.AddValues<T>(){:cs}` that takes in an array of parameters of type `T{:cs}`
usually if you did this without this feature enabled it wouldn't be possible to implement it because `T.Zero{:cs}` and the
`+operator{:cs}` wouldn't be possible to use. Now with Static Members in Interfaces & Generic Math we can add a generic
constraint of `where T : INumber<T>{:cs}` and it give's us access to a number of static members of `T{:cs}`. Most
importantly for this example: `T.Zero{:cs}` and `T.op_Addition{:cs}` (the + operator).

Then we can call it with any type that implements `INumber<TSelf>{:cs}` like `int{:cs}` or `double{:cs}`:
```cs
int addedIntValues = Generic.AddValues(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);
Console.WriteLine(addedIntValues); // returns 150

double addedDecimalValues = Generic.AddValues(0.10, 0.25, 0.65, 0.05, 0.20);
Console.WriteLine(addedDecimalValues); // returns 1.25
```

This is possible because the `INumber<T>{:cs}` interface is defined to be something like so and all of the base C# types
like; int, decimal, double, short etc implement this interface:

```cs
public interface INumber<TSelf>
  where TSelf : INumber<TSelf>
{
  static abstract TSelf Zero { get; }

  static abstract TResult operator +(TSelf left, TOther right);

  static virtual TResult operator checked +(TSelf left, TOther right) => left + right;
}
```

As you can see in the above example it's possible to define static methods as both `abstract{:cs}` and `virtual{:cs}`,
`virtual{:cs}` can be used with default implementations of functions that can be overridden. Whereas `abstract{:cs}` must
be implemented by the type that's implementing `INumber<TSelf>{:cs}`.

So now we know what Static Abstract/Virtual Members in Interfaces are, let's continue with some more detailed examples.

# Generic Math

Now we've already briefly covered [Generic Math][generic-math] but here are a few reasons using generic math can improve
your code both in applications and libraries:

- Utilize Generics where it didn't used to be possible, for example the dotnet team utilized Generic Math to remove near
  enough 800 lines of code from Enumerable.Min/Max.
- APIs can support a number of types without writing explicit overloads, with my `AddValues{:cs}` example if dotnet added
  a new type that implemented `INumber<TSelf>{:cs}` tomorrow my function would still work without any changes.
- Further to the last point, this also extends to custom types so if I wrote my own type that implemented
  `INumber<TSelf>{:cs}` then I would be able to call `AddValues{:cs}` with my custom type as well and that's pretty cool.

If you want to find out more about Generic Math you can read about it in the dotnet documentation [here][generic-math-docs].

# Parsing & Formatting

Another example of where this helps us reduce repeated code is with parsing and formatting. Historically if you wanted to
implement a function to parse a string (for example to get an `int{:cs}` out of a `Claim{:cs}`) then you might need to
implement an overload for each type you want to parse. There were options such as `Convert.ChangeType{:cs}` but I've
never found those to be very clean solutions.

But now with the introduction of Static Abstract Methods we get a few other interfaces supported by the base classes in
dotnet. One of these being `IParsable<TSelf>{:cs}` which provides us with Parse and TryParse static methods for the
passed in generic type like so:

```cs
public static class Generic
{
    public static T ParseValue<T>(string s, T defaultValue) where T : IParsable<T> =>
        T.TryParse(s, null, out var value) ? value : defaultValue;
}
```

Now the above example has been simplified quite greatly but you get the idea, you can pass a generic type and parse your
string data into it. There is also a `ISpanParsable<TSelf>{:cs}` that allows you to parse from a `ReadOnlySpan<char>{:cs}`
if your into that sort of thing (which I am ðŸ˜‰).

But what about formatting generic values as strings you may be asking? Well that's where the counterpart interface of
`IFormattable{:cs}` comes in (you could also use `ISpanFormattable{:cs}`) which exposes a `ToString{:.fn}`
with a format so that you can format generic values exactly as you want ðŸ˜Ž

Again one of the main benefits of this these new types of interfaces is that you can allow any type that implements
`IParsable<TSelf>{:cs}`/`IFormattable{:cs}` as your generic, reducing the amount of code required to support many types
including ones you didn't know about at the time of writing which is great for libraries.

# Strongly typed construction of Interfaces

One issue I've hit quite often while working on Generic/Extensible Code is constructing instances of types implementing
interfaces from generic code. Take for example an interface for a Build Server and an implementing type:

```cs
public interface IBuildServer
{
    bool IsCurrentServer { get; }
}

public sealed class AzurePipelines : IBuildServer
{
    private readonly Environment _environment;

    public AzurePipelines(Environment environment) => _environment = environment;

    public bool IsCurrentServer => !string.IsNullOrEmpty(_environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("TF_BUILD"));
}
```

If we want to construct an instance of `IBuildServer{:cs}` using a generic method, our only option would be to use
`Activator.CreateInstance(){:cs}` like so:

```cs
public static IBuildServer CreateBuildServer<T>() where T : IBuildServer
{
    return (IBuildServer?)Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(T), new Environment()) ?? throw new InvalidOperationException();
}
```

While this does work there are a few issues with this approach:

- What if the implementing type doesn't contain a matching constructor?
- What if I add a new parameter to the call to `Activator.CreateInstance(){:cs}`?
- While minimal `Activator.CreateInstance(){:cs}` does have some overhead when compared to using `new()`.
- If the interface changes and new parameters are included, you won't get a compile error in consuming interfaces.

So how could we workaround that problem, if only there was a feature that allowed us to define a static method on an
interface ðŸ¤” oh wait there is!

The first step to utilizing this is creating an abstract method on our interface that we can use to create a new instance
using our intended parameters. We can then implement this method in each type we want to construct:

```cs
public interface IBuildServer
{
    // ...

    static abstract IBuildServer Create(Environment environment, string optionalValue);
}

public sealed class AzurePipelines : IBuildServer
{
    public static IBuildServer Create(Environment environment, string _) => new AzurePipelines(environment);

    // ...
}
```

Again the main benefit here, it's an enforced contract so any type implementing `IBuildServer{:cs}` must implement
`IBuildServer.Create(Environment environment, string optionalValue){:cs}`. With this in place we can simplify our
`CreateBuildServer{:.fn}` function like so:

```cs
    public static IBuildServer CreateBuildServer<T>() where T : IBuildServer =>
        T.Create(new Environment(), "Some string value");
```

# Final thoughts

As I've already said I think this is a great feature, it allows for so much more than I've just listed above. I keep
thinking of new places to use this feature to simplify code that simply were not possible before and now hopefully with
the release of [.NET 8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8/) we might see wider adoption of this
great feature.
