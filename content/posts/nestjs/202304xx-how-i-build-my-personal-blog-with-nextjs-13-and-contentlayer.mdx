Over the past week or so in my spare time I've been busy building my new Personal Blog Site (which you are currently looking at ðŸ˜‰)
using [Next.js 13][nextjs-docs]'s new App Directory, [Contentlayer][contentlayer]'s easy to setup tooling for working
with Markdown/[MDX][mdx] and deployed it with just a few clicks to [Vercel][vercel]'s amazing platform completely for **free!**

Now it's _mostly finished_, only been working on tweaks and enhancements, and I've tested it fully by posting my first post. I've
decided to write about how I got this setup in around **5 hours** worth of work over a weekend and how you could do the same.
I'll cover some questions such as; Why the hell I would build my blog from scratch instead of using one of the countless offerings
out there, Why I chose the technologies I did to build it and What's are my future plans for this site?

# Why build a blog from scratch in the first place?

Why would you build a blog from scratch when there are [countless][forbes-best-blogging-platforms] existing platforms that would have
required a single click to setup? And it's an **extremely valid** question, even after spending my time building this site, even I am
still planning on re-publishing my content on [Medium][my-medium-profile] to reach a larger audience. But there are a few reasons why
I inevitably decided to build my own blog from scratch:

- **I'm just that type of person:** Being a Software Developer, and a naturally inquisitive person, I like to know how the tools I'm
  using work "under the hood". I've never been satisfied with just using something because it works, I always like to know how it works
  and more importantly why it works the way that it does.
- *The challenge and opportunity to learn:* Building a blog that statically generates content from Markdown requires quite a lot of effort
  to get setup and even more so if you want it to work properly and look nice while it's doing it. But to me that's part of the fun, the
  opportunity to expose myself to and learn new tools/frameworks that I might have otherwise overlooked because it wasn't for a "hobby
  project".
- **Full control and autonomy:** One of if not the most significant advantages of building your own personal website/blog from scratch is
  that you have 100% full control and autonomy over it. How it looks, how it works, how it's deployed and the content that's on it is
  completely up to you as you are the complete owner of all the code and content. You can add/remove features and do literally anything
  you set your mind to, if this is something you want I would highly recommend building from scratch, especially if you are quick picky.
- **Not locked into a specific platform:** By building and hosting everything yourself it means you aren't tied into a specific platform.
  You are free to move your site anytime you want, host it anywhere you want and quite honestly do anything you want to do with it!
- **Customization:** As you aren't using a specific platform/template you can do literally anything with it and make the site completely
  your own. There are literally 0 restrictions on what you can do, as long as it's possible with current web technology of course. If you
  do this right you can make your site truly unique!
